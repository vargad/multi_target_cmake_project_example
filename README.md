# Multiple Target CMake Project Example

This is an example project to demonstrate how to easily have multiple executables
in a project, so it's more convenient to practice, perhaps group exercises in a
project. This setup is also convenient to use in most many integrated development
environments (like Qt Creator).

To add new program, create a new source file and edit the CMakeLists.txt file
adding a new executable.
